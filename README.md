# React Native App using Expo CLI

- Keep track of upcoming Ekadasi dates
- Log into [Purebhakti](https://www.purebhakti.com/) and keep your settings (no more navigating to Web site. Keep your location on your device!)

## Why

I've always wanted to use an Ekadasi app. I've never seen one available (let me know if I missed it somewhere) for mobile devices so this is my attempt to please the Vaisnava community with a very simple App that displays the date of the next Ekadasi.

This is app is made with love for a non-profit program that selflessly serves thousands of people daily. This is my attempt to give back to the community.

## Homepage for the app

View the home landing page for this app here: https://dominickdesigns.space/ekadasi-app/

## Resources

This app uses the official [Pure Bhakti Calendar](http://www.purebhakti.com/resources/vaisnava-calendar) for dates in Vrndavana, India. For more details on Ekadasi [see Kripa.tv](https://kripa.tv/?s=ekadasi) & [Bhakta.org](https://bhakta.org/)

## What's inside

This app was created using [React Native Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

In order to run this on your local machine:

- [clone this git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine
- run `expo start`
- you should see options to view the app on android, ios, or web.
- you can plug in your iPhone or Android device to the computer and view it on the Expo app (first install Expo on your device). See [Expo docs for more details](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/)

## Roadmap

- push notification one day before and day of Ekadasi
- On day of Ekadasi display big green circle
- On day of Ekadasi display text glorifying that Ekadasi
